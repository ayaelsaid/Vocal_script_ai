  # 🎙️ Vocal Script AI – Adobe Express Add-on
-----------------------------------------------------------------
## 💡 Inspiration

Every time I've had an idea for a video or piece of content, I struggled with how to start or what to say. I soon realized many of my friends had the same challenge: while they could use AI to generate images, voices, or even videos, they didn’t know **what to actually say or write**.  

This common issue inspired me to create **Vocal Script AI** — a tool that helps content creators transform raw ideas into structured scripts with natural voiceovers.

## 🎯 Solution
**Vocal Script AI** is an intelligent Adobe Express Add-on that allows users to:
- Speak or type their idea
- Generate a structured script
- Instantly hear it as an AI voiceover

All in one seamless experience, powered by modern AI models.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. 🎤 User records or types their idea
2. ✍️ The tool turns it into a structured, readable script
3. 🔊 A voiceover is generated using AI models
4. 🎞️ The user can export or embed the script in their video content
